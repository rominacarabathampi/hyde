## Cancer Detection Project - Image Recognition
In summer 2019, I have worked on a capstone project for the completion of a Data Science diploma from Brainstation.
For this project I have developed my own convolutional neural network algorithm as the data were images of lymph node sections. I had build a model accuracy of 80-87% which were good enough for the given circumstances.
The data was provided by the [Patch Camelyon Challenge](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/).

## Trend Analysis of Crimes in Greater Toronto Area (GTA)
For a summer school project, I had analysed [data](http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/open-data) publicly-provided by the Toronto Police on Crime rates. Interestingly enough the highest crime hours are 12 am and 12 pm respectively. As for which areas are the most "dangerous" in GTA, read [here](https://github.com/rominacarabathampi/PythonProjects/blob/master/toronto_crime_rate.ipynb) from the Jupyter Notebook.

## Canadian Space App Challenge
In November 2019 I had participated in the [hackathon](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/events/2019/space-apps-2019.asp) organized by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). My team and I had won the challenge on the analysis of neutron radiation. We compared the data collected from the International Space Station(ISS) and from schools across Canada. From the students part, a lot of data had missing values, or incorrectly collected answers. We had replaced the missing values with predicted approximated data containing median of schools around the area.

## Canadian COVID-19 Data Study and Prediction
During the month of May, I had analysed the data from the COVID-19 published by the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html). The data file can be found on the website, under "Current situation". I had used Atom to write a Python code which contained a SEIR model (Susceptibility, Exposed, Infected, Recovered). To build this model I used a Runge-Kutta method of 4th degree order in which the four dimensions were SEIR. Then, I used a linear regression model to predict the data in June by studying the data from May. The project details and tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/rominacarabathampi/PythonProjects).

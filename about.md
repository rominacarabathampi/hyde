## Research Experience
My research experience include large data analysis regarding the FDA-approved drugs, building a convolutional neural network for image detection of cancerous tissue based on an article, as well as trend analysis of crime rates in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).

## Academic Background
My academic background is a Masters in Nanobiophysics with a focus on Bioinformatics from BIOTEC Institute in Dresden and Technical University of Dresden, Germany. I have completed my undergraduate in Physics with a focus on Medical Imaging and Radiation at West University of Timisoara. I have also completed a minor in Computer Science from Ioan Slavici University, in Timisoara, Romania. During the summer of 2019 I had completed a Data Science diploma as part of a bootcamp at Brainstation in Toronto.

## Other projects
Other research projects worth mentioning are: 
 - Built a Graphic User Interface for a computational calculator in collaboration with a graduate student from University of Illinois;
 - Developed a numerical simulation of crystal growth in zero-gravity conditions for University of West, Physics Department;
 - Alongside a remote team, I had worked on finding a correlation between heart ventricular shape and its function as part of Computational Physiology Summer School organized by SIMULA, University of Oslo and University of San Diego.

## Areas of Expertise
I have over two years of experience in Python and SQL, and a year experience in R which I has used to clean, organize, and perform dimensionality reductions (using PCA - principal component analysis), as well as develop an interactive map in R regarding drug similarities.

I have used Linux for 5 years, with proficiency in git, bash and unix commands.

I am familiar with both Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services as I have used them on personal and academic projects.

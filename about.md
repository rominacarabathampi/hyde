## About
I am a machine learning engineer with a masters in Bioinformatics from [BIOTEC TU Dresden](http://www.biotec.tu-dresden.de/). I am currently located in Waterloo, Ontario. 


## Areas of Expertise
I have over four years of experience in Python in both academic and industry environments with machine learning algorithms and the following libraries: numpy, pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, keras an matplotlib. I had used Python for most of the projects that can be found on my Github.

I have a year of experience in R from academia projects. I had used it to clean, organize and perform dimensionality reduction (using PCA - principal component analysis), as well as develop an interactive map regarding similarities of drugs that are on the market. This was a project focused on analysing current drug repositioning methods. More information about this project can be found [here](https://rominacarabathampi.ca/projects.html)

I have used Linux for 5 years and am proficient in git, bash and unix commands.

I am familiar with both Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services as I have used them on personal and academic projects.

For more details regarding the projects, please see the [Projects](https://rominacarabathampi.ca/) page.

## Research Experience
My research experience include large data analysis regarding the FDA-approved drugs, built a machine learning model for COVID-19 Canada predictions,
built a convolutional neural network for image detection of cancerous tissue, a trend analysis of crime rates in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and a hackathon challenge based on analyzing data collected on neutron radiation on the International Space Station (ISS) and across schools in Canada. 

## Academic Background
My academic background is a Masters in Nanobiophysics with a focus on Bioinformatics from [BIOTEC Institute in Dresden and Technical University of Dresden](http://www.biotec.tu-dresden.de/), Germany. I have completed my undergraduate in Physics with a focus on Medical Imaging and Radiation at [West University of Timisoara](https://physics.uvt.ro/). I have also completed a minor in Computer Science from [Ioan Slavici University](http://ns2.islavici.ro/index.php), in Timisoara, Romania. During the summer of 2019, I had completed a Data Science diploma as part of a bootcamp at [Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/) in Toronto.

## Other projects
Other research projects worth mentioning are: 
 - Built a Graphic User Interface for a computational calculator in collaboration with a graduate student from University of Illinois;
 - Developed a numerical simulation of crystal growth in zero-gravity conditions for University of West, Physics Department;
 - Alongside a remote team, I had worked on finding a correlation between heart ventricular shape and its function as part of Computational Physiology Summer School organized by SIMULA, University of Oslo and University of San Diego.
